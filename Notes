Pushing Future Changes To Your Heroku App
If you make additional changes to your local code files and 
want to push those changes up to Heroku you can simply run this command:
git add -A
git commit -m 'Your message to yourself regarding what you changed'
git push heroku master


How does Git know where to push through when you do "git push heroku master"
- "heroku" is the name of the remote that was setup
- When you typed in "heroku git:remote -a todoapp-trial", it set up the pointer to the location
- Type in "git remote -v" to see the list of remote locations for this repository
